The project consists of the following main files:

parcial.html: Contains the HTML structure of the application.
parcial.css: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
parcial.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for manipulating nodes and edges (not provided but mentioned in the HTML).

parcial.html
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the web application. It includes sections for:

The title and authors of the application.
A container for displaying the graph (#grafo).
A form for node management (#formularioNodos), which includes inputs for node name, duration, cost, prerequisites, and post-requisites, along with buttons for creating, deleting, and editing nodes.
A form for edge management (#formularioAristas), which includes inputs for edge name and cost, along with buttons for connecting nodes, deleting edges, editing edges, finding the shortest path, and finding the critical path.
A stylized input for uploading a JSON file.
Scripts for loading D3.js and parcial.js.
parcial.css
The CSS file provides the styles for the web application, including:

Basic styling for the body, forms, and containers.
Styling for centering and layout adjustments.
Custom styles for buttons and file upload inputs.
Styles for highlighting minimum paths and critical paths in the graph.
